# Google Sign-In Email Verification Redirect Fix

## Problem
When users signed in with Google, they were being redirected to the email verification page (`/verify-email`) even though Google had already verified their email address.

## Root Cause
The backend API returns user data with snake_case field names (`email_verified`), but the frontend expects camelCase (`emailVerified`). When the backend sync response was received, the `emailVerified` property was not being properly mapped, causing Google sign-in users to appear as unverified.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Field Mapping in AuthContext
**File:** `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`

Added proper mapping from backend snake_case to frontend camelCase when syncing Firebase users with the backend:

```javascript
// Map backend user data to match frontend format (snake_case to camelCase)
const mappedBackendUser = {
  ...syncResponse.user,
  emailVerified: syncResponse.user.email_verified !== undefined 
    ? syncResponse.user.email_verified 
    : firebaseUser.emailVerified, // Fallback to Firebase value
  photoURL: syncResponse.user.photo_url,
  displayName: syncResponse.user.full_name
};
```

### 2. Clarified Email Verification Logic
**File:** `frontend/src/App.js`

Updated comments to clarify that Google sign-in users automatically have `emailVerified: true`:

```javascript
// Check if user is authenticated but email not verified
// Only redirect to email verification for email/password sign-ups (not Google sign-in)
// Google sign-in users have their email already verified by Google, so emailVerified will be true
// This condition will only be true for email/password registrations that need verification
if (user && !user.emailVerified) {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/verify-email" element={<EmailVerification />} />
      <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/verify-email" replace />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Google Sign-In Flow:
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Firebase authenticates with Google (email is already verified by Google)
3. `firebaseUser.emailVerified` is `true`
4. Backend sync creates/updates user with `email_verified: true`
5. Frontend maps `email_verified` → `emailVerified: true`
6. User bypasses `/verify-email` and goes directly to dashboard ✅

### Email/Password Registration Flow:
1. User registers with email/password
2. Firebase creates account with `emailVerified: false`
3. Verification email is sent
4. User is redirected to `/verify-email` page
5. After clicking verification link, `emailVerified` becomes `true`
6. User can access the dashboard ✅

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js** - Added field mapping for backend sync response
2. **frontend/src/App.js** - Updated comments for clarity

## Testing

### Test Google Sign-In:
1. Click "Continue with Google" on login page
2. Select Google account
3. Should redirect directly to `/dashboard` (NOT `/verify-email`) ✅

### Test Email/Password Registration:
1. Click "Sign Up" and register with email/password
2. Should redirect to `/verify-email` page ✅
3. Check email and click verification link
4. Should redirect to dashboard ✅

## Backend API Response Format

The backend returns user data in snake_case:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "full_name": "User Name",
    "email_verified": true,  // ← snake_case
    "photo_url": "https://...",
    "firebase_uid": "abc123"
  }
}
```

Frontend now properly maps this to camelCase for consistency across the application.
