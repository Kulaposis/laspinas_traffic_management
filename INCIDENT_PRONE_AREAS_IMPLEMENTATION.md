### Color Coding System
- **Red (Critical)**: Risk Score 80-100
- **Orange (High)**: Risk Score 60-79
- **Yellow (Medium)**: Risk Score 40-59
- **Green (Low)**: Risk Score 0-39

### Data Sources
1. **Government Reports**: Official MMDA and PNP data
2. **Social Media**: Twitter, Facebook community groups
