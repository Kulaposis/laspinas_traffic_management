# Route Alternatives Feature - Google Maps Style

## Overview
Enhanced the Traffic Map to display multiple route alternatives similar to Google Maps, allowing users to view and select different routes visually on the map.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Close Button on Route Panel**
- Added a close (X) button to the "Route Found" panel
- Users can now easily dismiss the route and start a new search
- Button is positioned next to other action buttons (Layers, Save, Simulate, Start)

### 2. **Multiple Routes Display on Map**
- All route alternatives are now displayed on the map simultaneously
- Different routes are shown with different visual styles:
  - **Selected route**: Thicker line (weight: 8), full opacity, primary color
  - **Alternative routes**: Thinner line (weight: 3), semi-transparent (opacity: 0.6)
- Routes are interactive:
  - **Hover**: Route becomes thicker and fully opaque
  - **Click**: Selects that route as the active route

### 3. **Enhanced Route Alternatives Panel**
- Shows all available routes with detailed information
- Each route displays:
  - Route name (e.g., "Alternative 1", "Alternative 2")
  - Duration and distance
  - Traffic conditions (color-coded: green/yellow/red)
  - Special features (tolls, highways)
  - **Selected indicator**: Blue checkmark and "Selected" badge
- Visual hierarchy:
  - Recommended route: 🏆 trophy icon
  - Selected route: Blue background with left border
  - Other routes: Gray numbered icons

### 4. **View Alternatives Button**
- Added a "Layers" button on the Route Found panel
- Only visible when multiple routes are available
- Clicking reopens the route alternatives panel

## User Flow

### Finding Routes:
1. User enters origin and destination
2. Clicks "Find Route"
3. System calculates multiple route alternatives
4. **All routes are displayed on the map** with different colors/styles
5. Route alternatives panel appears showing all options

### Selecting Routes:
**Option A - Click on Map:**
- User clicks on any route line on the map
- That route becomes selected (thicker, highlighted)
- Route information panel updates

**Option B - Click in Panel:**
- User clicks on a route in the alternatives panel
- Map updates to highlight the selected route
- Panel shows "Selected" badge on chosen route

### Closing Routes:
- Click the X button on the Route Found panel
- All routes are cleared from the map
- User can start a new search

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`frontend/src/pages/TrafficMap.jsx`**
   - Added close button to Route Found panel
   - Added "View Alternatives" button
   - Updated `handleGetRoute` to store all alternatives
   - Enabled `showAllRoutes` prop when multiple routes exist
   - Added `onRouteClick` handler to `RouteLayer`

2. **`frontend/src/components/RouteLayer.jsx`** (already supported)
   - Already had `showAllRoutes` prop
   - Already had `onRouteClick` handler
   - Renders multiple routes with interactive hover/click

### Key Changes:

```javascript
// Store all route alternatives
setRouteAlternatives(validRoutes);

// Show alternatives panel if multiple routes
if (validRoutes.length > 1) {
  setShowRouteAlternatives(true);
  setSelectedRoute(processedRouteData.recommended_route || validRoutes[0]);
}

// Enable showing all routes on map
<RouteLayer
  routes={routeAlternatives}
  selectedRoute={selectedRoute}
  showAllRoutes={routeAlternatives.length > 1}
  onRouteClick={selectRoute}
  ...
/>
```
