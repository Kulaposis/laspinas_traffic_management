# 🚗 Travel Simulation - Quick Start Guide

## What is Travel Simulation?

Travel Simulation lets you **virtually travel** along a route to preview the journey, test the navigation system, or demonstrate features. The simulated trip is automatically saved to your travel history!

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Plan Your Route
1. Open **Traffic Map** page
2. Enter **starting point** (or use current location)
3. Enter **destination**
4. Click **"Route"** button

### Step 2: Start Simulation
1. Review the route displayed on map
2. Click the green **"Simulate"** button
3. Watch the vehicle animate along the route!

### Step 3: Control & Finish
- **Pause/Resume**: Click ⏸/▶ button
- **Speed**: Choose 1x, 2x, 5x, or 10x
- **Stop**: Click X to end early
- **Auto-Complete**: Simulation saves to history when done!

## 🎨 Visual Elements

### Map Markers

- 🔵 **Blue Dot** = Origin (starting point)
- 🔴 **Red Dot** = Destination (end point)
- 🟢 **Green Dot** = Simulated vehicle (moves along route)

### Route Line
- **Blue line** = Your selected route
- **Animated marker** = Current simulated position

## ⚡ Speed Options

| Speed | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **1x** | Normal speed | Realistic preview |
| **2x** | 2x faster | Detailed review |
| **5x** | 5x faster | Quick overview |
| **10x** | 10x faster | Fast demo |

**Tip**: Start with 5x for a good balance between speed and detail!

## 💾 What Gets Saved?

When simulation completes, it saves to **Travel History**:

✅ Origin and destination  
✅ Route distance (km)  
✅ Route duration (minutes)  
✅ Simulation timestamp  
✅ Traffic conditions  
✅ Marked as "Simulated trip"  

**View saved trips**: Click hamburger menu → Travel History

## 📱 Example Use Cases

### 1. **Preview Your Commute**
```
Morning: Home → Office
1. Enter addresses
2. Click "Route"
3. Click "Simulate" (5x speed)
4. Review the route and turns
```

### 2. **Demo to Friends**
```
Show off the navigation system:
1. Pick interesting route
2. Start simulation at 10x
3. Show real-time progress
4. Highlight turn-by-turn
```

### 3. **Plan Unfamiliar Trip**
```
Going somewhere new:
1. Enter destination
2. Simulate at 2x speed
3. Study each turn carefully
4. Note landmarks and streets
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Pause to Study
- Pause simulation at complex intersections
- Review turn instructions carefully
- Resume when ready

### Tip 2: Speed Adjustment
- Start slow (1x-2x) for unfamiliar routes
- Speed up (5x-10x) for routes you know
- Change speed anytime during simulation

### Tip 3: Multiple Runs
- Run simulation multiple times
- Try different routes to same destination
- Compare which route you prefer

### Tip 4: Check History
- View all simulated trips in Travel History
- See patterns in your route planning
- Review frequently visited locations

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does simulation use real GPS?**  
A: No, it's animated. Real navigation uses GPS.

**Q: Can I simulate without being logged in?**  
A: You can simulate, but it won't save to history.

**Q: How long does simulation take?**  
A: Depends on route length and speed:
- Short route (5km) at 10x: ~30 seconds
- Long route (20km) at 5x: ~2 minutes

**Q: Can I stop simulation early?**  
A: Yes! Click the X button anytime.

**Q: Does it count as a real trip?**  
A: It's marked as "Simulated trip" in history.

**Q: Can I simulate the same route multiple times?**  
A: Yes! Each simulation saves separately.
