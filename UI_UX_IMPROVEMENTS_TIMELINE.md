## ✨ Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Clear Instructions Added** 📝
**Before**: No guidance on how to use the feature  
**After**: 
- "👆 Click on any time bar below or drag the slider to see traffic predictions"

### 2. **Larger, More Prominent Display** 📊

#### Selected Hour Card
**Improvements**:
- ✅ Increased time display from `text-2xl` to `text-3xl` (50% larger)
- ✅ Larger emoji icons (`text-4xl` instead of small icons)
- ✅ Split information into clear sections:

**Why**: Critical information is immediately visible without squinting

---

### 3. **Time Labels on Every Bar** 🕐

**Before**: Only 6 time labels at the bottom (12 AM, 4 AM, 8 AM, etc.)  
**After**: 
- Time labels appear every 3 hours (12A, 3A, 6A, 9A, 12P, 3P, 6P, 9P)
- Selected bar shows its exact time
- Compact format: "3A" instead of "3 AM" for space efficiency

**Why**: Users can quickly identify specific hours without counting bars

---

### 4. **"NOW" Indicator** ⏰

**Added**: Animated "NOW" badge on current hour bar
- Blue background with white text
- Pulsing animation to draw attention
- Positioned above the bar

**Why**: Users instantly see the current time and current traffic conditions

---

### 5. **Contextual Time Labels** 🌅

**Added**: Four time-of-day sections with emojis
- 🌙 **Midnight** (12 AM - 6 AM)
- 🌅 **Morning** (6 AM - 12 PM)
- ☀️ **Afternoon** (12 PM - 6 PM)
- 🌆 **Evening** (6 PM - 12 AM)

**Why**: Helps users mentally map times to their daily routine

---

### 6. **Enhanced Legend with Descriptions** 🎯

**Before**: Simple color dots with "Light", "Moderate", "Heavy"  
**After**: Three detailed cards with:
- Color-coded backgrounds
- Descriptive titles
- Practical meanings:
  - 🟢 **Light Traffic** → "Fast & Easy"
  - 🟡 **Moderate** → "Some Delays"
  - 🔴 **Heavy Traffic** → "Slow Moving"

**Why**: Users understand what each color means in practical terms

---

### 7. **Better Visual Hierarchy** 📐

#### Spacing & Layout

- ✅ Better shadows: `shadow-lg` for depth

#### Typography
- ✅ Bolder text: `font-black` for main time
